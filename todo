----
- [ ] report if charging. see ds4 spec.
- [ ] charging colours. see ds4 spec.
- [ ] ps3 randomly and continuesly reports battery
    is low when it is not. this was the case even
    before I implemented the battery levels reporting
    to PS3
- [ ] ps3 reports low battery when pic is
  connected but no controller is.. strange

- [ ] colour persistence/user pref persistence
  (deadzones, colours, interface) in flash across
  updates (is this even possible?) this has to
  optimal we dont have a lot of space look up pico 2
  w specs, there are plenty of implementation
  online check them out just make sure you are
  choosing correct and performant code not a lacky
  one.
- [ ] feedback via double blink of pico led when
  something is stored.
- [c] implement colour selection in web ui + add
  an option to introduce a delay in ms to any
  button before it registers it's trigger. make
  sure this is performant. that's a different
  project and honeslty idc too much about it. <- typo that's how little i care!


- [x] change default colour i.e. when controller
  comes on to something more neutral, like white
  with half brightness.

- [ ] sixaxis? is this even possible?

- [x] BUG: does not look for devices upon
  disconnect (it used to even as far back as alpha 3!)

- [x] intercept combo and dont pass it to host

- [ ] phantom keys. up arrow or joystick up idk
- [ ] phantom LEFT arrow presses happen 2-3 times
  rapidly in succession.

think understand implementation in it's entirely
think again plan then execute. minimal changes,
only as needed. follow best practices.

make sure it's performant, non repetitive, follows
best practices, mem safe and all of that

take a second look at all this code and make sure it's performant mem safe follwos best practices and is not bloated. consider split second and ms optimisations this is important. and make sure you dont repeat yourself. BTW what say you about this?
